# Artifact: ApexLex ARC Prototype (v0.1)

This directory contains the v0.1 prototype artifact for the ApexLex ARC project. It is explicitly prototype-grade and must be hardened before production use.

Files:
- `arc_loop.py` — prototype runtime loop (toy belief, projector, signed log)
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies for running the prototype
- `tests/` — small unit tests for projector and log chain

See top-level `DEPLOYMENT.md` for run and hardening instructions.
